# Design of Warehouse Slotting Process


Python model used to improve SKU allocation. 

Objective of this project was to design an end-to-end tool for the client that would allocate SKUs into their warehouse layout to maximize low-levek picker productivity.


This model will import a list of store orders and SKU information, uses 5 different SKU assignment methods to assign SKUs within a warehouse, and calculates the distance an order picker will traverse in the warehouse. The model will then determine the most optimal SKU assignment method for this specific set of store orders.

Example of the input GUI is shown below:
