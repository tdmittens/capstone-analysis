# capstone-analysis


Python model used to improve SKU allocation. 

This model will import a list of store orders and SKU information, uses 5 different SKU assignment methods to assign SKUs within a warehouse, and calculates the distance an order picker will traverse in the warehouse. The model will then determine the most optimal SKU assignment method for this specific set of store orders.
